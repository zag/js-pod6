=begin pod
Let's consider two common proverbs:

=begin item
I<The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.>

This is a common myth and an unconscionable slur on the Spanish
people, the majority of whom are extremely attractive.
=end item

=begin item
I<The early bird gets the worm.>

In deciding whether to become an early riser, it is worth
considering whether you would actually enjoy annelids
for breakfast.
=end item

As you can see, folk wisdom is often of dubious value.
